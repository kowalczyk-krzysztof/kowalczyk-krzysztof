Hi there :wave:

My name is Krzysztof and I'm a software engineer. When I work, my goal is to create useful and high quality products people can enjoy. Finding the right balance between user experience and efficiency is a challenge, but I believe I have what it takes to achieve it.

**Give me a problem and I will find a solution.**

Fluent in English and Polish. Advanced in Japanese (N2 level).
