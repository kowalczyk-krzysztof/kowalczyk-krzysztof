### Hi there :wave:

My name is Krzysztof and I'm a full stack developer. When I code, my goal is to create useful and high quality products other people can enjoy. I spend a lot of time on the internet and because of that I know what people want to see. Finding the right balance between user experience and efficiency is a challenge, but I believe I have what it takes to achieve it. Give me a problem and I will find a solution.

Fluent in English and Polish. Advanced in Japanese (N2 level).

Open to learn and use new technologies and frameworks.
